## 📖 Overview
This project is a Java implementation of a Genetic Algorithm, a stochastic optimization algorithm inspired by natural selection and genetics. 

## 🧬 Genetic Algorithm Idea
The idea behind the Genetic Algorithm is to find the best solution to a problem by mimicking the process of natural selection and genetics. The algorithm starts with a population of individuals, each one representing a possible solution to the problem. Each individual is evaluated and assigned a fitness score, which represents how good the solution is. The individuals with the best fitness scores are selected to reproduce, and the offspring of the reproduction process will be the new population. The process is repeated until a solution is found or a maximum number of generations is reached.
